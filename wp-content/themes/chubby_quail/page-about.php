				<p>Chubby Quail was born out of a love for film. The first short I made was on my iPhone. I filmed my fiancee cooking.
				 I edited it, added music and titles and then showed it to her. She loved it. We watched it over and over. A silly minute-long little video on a phone. 
				 But it was more than that- it was a love letter. And like all dear mementos it's something that can be treasured and re-visited.</p>
				 <p>I consider it an honor to be a part of your wedding day and to get to create a beautiful film for you to enjoy.</p>
